## Building an ArrayList
Making our own dynamic array -- from scratch!

---

### What's Involved

--

To recap:

An ArrayList is a more flexible array.

--

It knows how to expand itself when it runs out of space.

![Expanding arraylist](TODO)

--

It shuffles items around to allow for inserting at a specific index.

![Insert arraylist](TODO)

--

It doesn't leave any gaps when we remove an item.

![Remove arraylist](TODO)

--

And it offers a simple interface for the user.

![Simple interface](TODO)

--

It's so simple to use!

But is it simple to build?

--

Let's see...

---

### Why We're Doing This

--

Java already provides a very well-made ArrayList.

We don't *have* to make our own.

--

And we won't even continue to use our custom version.

Not after this exercise.
